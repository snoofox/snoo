## How it works

- Uses Reddit's public JSON API (no authentication required)
- Stores subscriptions and cached data in a local SQLite database (`data.sqlite3`)
- Posts are cached for 1 hour, comments for 30 minutes
- Old data is automatically cleaned up every 6 hours
- Theme preferences are persisted in the database
